# woocommerce-getaddressio
Wordpress Plugin to integrate the getaddress.io API with WooCommerce

## What do?
Address finder, innit

## API Key?
https://getaddress.io/, stick it in the settings page

## Why no plugin repository?
CBA. Don't like SVN. Sick of "the sky is falling" emails from wordpress every time there's a minor update, begging me to check compatibility.

Please leave me alone, I am so very tired
